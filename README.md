## Description

This portfolio was created to showcase my work in the Penn LPS Full Stack Coding Boot Camp.

This responsive portfolio was implemeneted by using Bootstrap 4.5 framework - all images and layouts are responsive. Within my portfolio, you will find that it contains 3 responsive web pages - Index/About Me, Contact Me, and My Portfolio. 

## Implementation

- The Navbar is implemented by Bootstrap.om 
- The About Me page is implemented with Bootstrap - I used many grids that included rows and columns.
- The Contact Me page is implemented with Bootstrap - For this I used many grids as well.
- The My Portfolio page is implemented with Bootstrap - I created the portfolio gallery by using grids - containers, rows, columns.
- Each page has been checked with the html validator tool.

## CSS, Bootstrap, & jQuery

- Each and every page is 100% CSS and Bootstrap.
- All images and layouts are responsive - some components that I used from Bootstrap are Cards, Forms, and Navbar. 
- For the portfolio page, I used jQuery to create an on click event for the submit buttons. I also used jQuery within the contact me page for the submit button.
