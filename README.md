<h1 align="center">My Portfolio</h1>

## Description

My Portfolio implemeneted by Bootstrap. Within my portfolio, you will find that it contains 3 sections- Index/About Me, Contact Me, and My Portfolio. Each of these sections are responsive. Within the Index/About Me, I included a short paragraph about who I am and three images of "The Ones I Love" - My Family, My Boyfriend, and My Pup. Within the Contact Me section, I created a form that includes First Name, Last Name, Email Address, and Message. I created this by using the form template from GetBootstrap.com - the template allowed me to add and delete form fields. Within the Portfolio section, I created a Portfolio gallery that includes my projects.


## About the project

### Drag and Drop

- Drag and drop is implemented with native html5 drag and drop api with @drag, @dragend, @dragenter eventlisteners on the Card.vue component.
- Libraries like Vue.draggable were not used as i had to write most of the drag and drop logic according to the solitaire game type and I also had to **MOVE** the stack of cards.
- Ghost image in drag is removed instead the **whole stack** of card moves with cursor change.

### CSS

- Each and every card is 100% css except the SVG of the suit in the center of the card,which is made by illustrator tool.
