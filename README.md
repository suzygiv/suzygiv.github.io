## Description

This portfolio was created to showcase my work in the Penn LPS Full Stack Coding Boot Camp.

This responsive portfolio runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and Bootstrap CSS framework powered by JavaScript - all images and layouts are responsive. Within my portfolio, you will find that it contains 3 responsive web pages - Index/About Me, Contact Me, and My Portfolio. 

## Implementation

- The Navbar is implemented by Bootstrap 4.5 Framework
- The About Me page is implemented with Bootstrap - I used many grids that included rows and columns.
- The Contact Me page is implemented with Bootstrap - For this I used many grids as well.
- The My Portfolio page is implemented with Bootstrap - I created the portfolio gallery by using grids - containers, rows, columns.
- Each page has been checked with the html validator tool.

## CSS, Bootstrap, & jQuery

- Each and every page is 100% CSS and Bootstrap.
- All images and layouts are responsive - some components that I used from Bootstrap are Cards, Forms, Buttons and Navbar. 
- For the portfolio page, I used jQuery to create an on click event for the submit buttons. I also used jQuery within the contact me page to create an on click event for the submit button.
